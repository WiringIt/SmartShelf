## Using Swept Frequency Capacitive Sensing
##  This is a research project where we aimed to sense the position of hand using various tools and thereby predict consumer behaviour at retail stores.
### We referred to this paper for building the circuit:
[nime2014_515.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18554242/nime2014_515.pdf)
### Components:
### 1. Raspberry Pi Pico W
### 2. AD 9840A
### 2. Capacitor
### 3. Inductor
### 4. Resistor
### 5. Diode
## We've collected few sets of data to analyse the mathematical correlations and deriving patterns by generating graphs of amplitude vs frequency.
