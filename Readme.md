# SmartShelf
## Using Swept Frequency Capacitive Sensing
##  This is a research project where we aimed to sense the position of hand using various tools and thereby predict consumer behaviour at retail stores.
### We referred to this paper for building the circuit:

## We've collected 20 sets of data on a 28 * 28 metal plate grid to analyse the mathematical correlations and deriving patterns by generating graphs of amplitude vs frequency.
## Using this data we aimed to implement tinyML on Raspberry Pi Pico W to provide a cheap and accurate solution to the consumer-service related problems of retail stores.
